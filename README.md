# Stomper & Wombat's Database Design & Implementation

This project was completed in collaboration with fellow students Hana Ghazi and Denial Tan as part of CSE 5241 Introduction to Database Systems at The Ohio State University SU'21.

The fictional story begins with Stomper & Wombat's hiring us to design and implement a relational database system as part of their major development effort.

Through the project file, we are supplied relevant information about the company, its operations and employee points of view.

The development and completion of our project followed a chronology of achieved milestones described by their corresponding numbers as follows:
  1) The first step was putting together a requirements document which contained well-written & categorized business rules that will determine how the new database system will operate. In addition, mock-ups of data entry screens from the points of view of different stakeholders were supplied.
  2) From the requirements document, a conceptual design using an Enhanced Entity-Relationship (EER) diagram was formulated.
  3) Then, the conceptual design was turned into a relational model normalized to the BCNF level.
  4) Relevant external views and reports for stakeholders were brainstormed and compiled into a document.
  5) The database was implemented and tested in MySQL server.
